# Py-NeuNet
Very simple neural network framework
Does not require big computing power, but
cannot scale too much.

Usable imports:
* neunet.NeuralNetwork.NeuralNetwork
* neunet.NeuralActivators
* neunet.NeuralInputs.NeuralInput
* neunet.NeuralInputs.Neural2DInput
* neunet.NeuralErrors.NeuralError

Look for example usages in examples/ folder
